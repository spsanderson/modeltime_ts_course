```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = TRUE,
    message = F,
    warning = F,
    # This should allow Rmarkdown to locate the data
    root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file()
)
```

# Challenge Objective

Your goal is to forecast revenue, and you'd like to understand if their are relationships between Revenue trends / spikes and webpage traffic (do spikes in revenue relate to traffic being driven to specific pages?).

# Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
library(lubridate)
library(DataExplorer)
```


# Data

Read in the following data sets. 

## Transactions Revenue

```{r}
transactions_tbl  <- read_rds("../00_data/transactions_weekly.rds")
transactions_tbl
```


## Google Analytics by Page

```{r}
google_analytics_by_page_tbl <- read_rds("../00_data/google_analytics_by_page_daily.rds")
google_analytics_by_page_tbl
```

# Visualize the Data

- Look for Missing Data
- Determine the Frequency of each Dataset

## Transactions

- Start with `transactions_tbl`
- Use `plot_time_series()` to visualize purchased at vs revenue
- Answer the question: What is the time frequency? * WEEKLY

```{r}
transactions_tbl %>%
    plot_time_series(
        .date_var = purchased_at
        , .value  = revenue
    )
```


## Sessions by Page 

There are 20 pages x 3 Metrics (pageViews, organicSearch, and sessions). To make it easier to visualize, do this:

1. Start with `google_analytics_by_page_tbl`
2. Group by "pagePath" - These are the pages that are being visited
3. Visualize just the "sessions" - This will cut down the data
4. Use `plot_time_series()` with `.interactive = FALSE` and `.facet_ncol = 4` (this helps to visualize all of the facets)

```{r, fig.height=7}
google_analytics_by_page_tbl %>%
    group_by(pagePath) %>%
    plot_time_series(
        .date_var = date
        , .value  = sessions
        , .interactive = FALSE
        , .facet_ncol = 4
    )
```

# Aggregation to Common Frequency

We need to aggregate both data sets to get them on a common frequency before we can join them

## Aggregate Transactions to Weekly

1. Start with `transactions_tbl`
2. Use `summarise_by_time()` with `.by = "week"`, and `sum()` the revenue.
3. Save as a new variable called `transactions_weekly_tbl`

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```
## Aggregate GA Page Sessions to Weekly

1. Start with `google_analytics_by_page_tbl`
2. Select just the "date", "pagePath" and "sessions" columns.
3. Group by "pagePath"
4. Use `summarise_by_time()` with `.by = "week"`, and `sum()` the sessions.
5. Use `pivot_wider()` to pivot the names from "pagePath" and values from "sessions" to a wide data. Use `names_prefix = "sessions_"` to identify the new columns as coming from sessions. 
6. Select "date" and any columns that `contains("/p/")` (these are product pages)
7. Store the wrangled data as `product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl`

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

# Join the Datasets

## Left Join

- Use `left_join()` to join `transactions_weekly_tbl` and `product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl`
- Store the joined data as `transactions_product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl`

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

## Inspect Missing

- Use `plot_missing()` to inspect the missing data in `transactions_product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl`

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

# Identify Relationships

```{r}
# Load Checkpoint Data
transactions_product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl <- 
    read_rds("challenge_01_data_checkpoints/transactions_product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl.rds")
```

## Visualize the Joined Data

1. Start with `transactions_product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl`
2. `pivot_longer()` everything except "purchased_at" to form the data for plotting. This creates 2 columns, "name" and "value".
3. Group by "name"
3. Use `plot_time_series()` to visualize "purchased_at" vs "value". Use `.facet_ncol = 3

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

## Remove Columns with Too Much Missing

Several of the columns have a lot of missing data. These are pages that did not exist until recently in the data, and unfortunately we aren't going to be able to use them because they will result in data too few rows for the analysis. 

1. Start with `transactions_product_page_sessions_weekly_tbl`
2. __De-select__ columns containing "bundle" and anything that `ends_with()` "with-r/". These columns have very low data.
3. Store the subset data as `transactions_product_page_subset_tbl`

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

## Transform Data

1. Remove missing data with `drop_na()`
2. Apply cross-wise transformations using `mutate()` and `across()`:
    - First take the Log Plus 1: `log1p()`
    - Then standardize to mean 0, std-dev 1: `standardize_vec()`
3. Store the transformed data as `log_standardized_transactions_product_page_tbl`
    

```{r}
# CODE HERE
```

## Cross Correlations

Visualize cross correlations between revenue and anything that `contains("session")`:

1. Start with `log_standardized_transactions_product_page_tbl`
2. Use `plot_acf_diagnostics()` with:
    - `.ccf_vars = contains("session")`
    - `.show_ccf_vars_only = TRUE`
    - `.facet_ncol = 2`


```{r}
# CODE HERE
```



# Results

- What can you say about the relationship between 101 Course Page visits & revenue?

- What about the relationship between Jumpstart, Learning Labs PRO page visits and Revenue?
